# Findings — tooling / debug server / harness

## A debug-server client disconnect kills the whole game (SIGPIPE)
- **symptom:** the live port dies ("connection refused" on the next dbgclient call) when a debug client is killed / times out mid-reply — looked like a crash on entering a scene, but no abort/diagnostic is printed.
- **status:** fixed 10a07e0
- **cause:** the debug server's socket write() raised SIGPIPE with the DEFAULT disposition (terminate the process); a dropped/timed-out dbgclient connection therefore killed the game.
- **fix:** dbg_server.cpp dbg_server_start: signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN). A dropped client now just makes write()<0 and drops that one connection.
- **refs:** journal later-252; dbg_server.cpp dbg_server_start

## Reaching the New-Game cutscene live: mash START (it confirms the menu AND skips FMV)
- **symptom:** automated drive (debug-server taps) loops in the attract demo / never reaches the field cutscene (stage 0x8010637C); the title menu's confirm wasn't registering.
- **status:** known-good (how-to)
- **cause:** the real-time menu→cutscene cadence; the attract demo replays OP.STR if no valid selection lands.
- **fix:** drive: tap START at the title demo (→ menu, scene-active=2), then mash START — it both confirms New Game and skips the FMV — and poll `stage` (debug server) for 0x8010637C. The debug server now survives client drops (SIGPIPE fix above) so a `timeout`-killed dbgclient won't kill the game. Headless can't reproduce the menu cadence — needs the windowed game.
