// class Render — the PC-native RENDER SUBSYSTEM umbrella owned by Core.
//
// PROPER OOP: one instance per Core, reached as `c->mRender->...`. This class exists to group the
// per-Core render-side subsystems (currently just NodeXform; scene-graph submit / walk / project etc.
// will migrate in here over time, out of the engine_submit.cpp / engine_render*.cpp grab-bags).
//
// Owned by Core via a POINTER (`Core::mRender`) — construction/destruction lives in the Core ctor/dtor
// in runtime/recomp/core.cpp; back-pointer `mCore` is wired there, and each embedded sub-subsystem's
// own back-pointer is wired there too. Callers reach members as `c->mRender->mNodeXform.build(node)`.
